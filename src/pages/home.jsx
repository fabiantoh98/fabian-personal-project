        <p> Welcome to Fabian Personal Project </p>
        <p> 
          The main aim of this github page is to showcase some of my personal project using react hosted on <i>github.io</i>.
          Due to limitation of github pages, I will only be able to build simple react pages for now.
          Most of the development work will be focus on functionality first.
          In the future, more effort will be put into design, UI/UX as well as cross-device responsiveness.
        </p>
        <p> Currently, there are a few working applications but development is still in progress </p>
        <p> Thank you!</p>
      </div>
