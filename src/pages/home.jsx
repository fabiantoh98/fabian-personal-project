        <p> Welcome to Fabian Personal Project </p>
        <p> The main aim of this github page is to showcase some of my personal project using react hosted on github.io</p>
        <p> Due to limitation of github pages, I will only be able to build simple react pages for now </p>
        <p> Currently, in game tab the random number game is functional. However do note that development is still in progress</p>
        <p> Thank you!</p>
      </div>
